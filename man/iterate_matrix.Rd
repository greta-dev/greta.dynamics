\usage{
iterate_matrix(
  matrix,
  initial_state = rep(1, ncol(matrix)),
  niter = 100,
  tol = 1e-06
)
}
\arguments{
\item{matrix}{either a square 2D transition matrix (with dimensions m x m),
or a 3D array (with dimensions n x m x m), giving one or more transition
matrices to iterate}

\item{initial_state}{either a column vector (with m elements) or a 3D array
(with dimensions n x m x 1) giving one or more initial states from which to
iterate the matrix}

\item{niter}{a positive integer giving the maximum number of times to iterate
the matrix}

\item{tol}{a scalar giving a numerical tolerance, below which the algorithm
is determined to have converged to the same growth rate in all stages}
}
\value{
a named list with five greta arrays:
\itemize{
\item{\code{lambda}} {a scalar or vector giving the ratio of the first stage
values between the final two iterations.}
\item{\code{stable_state}} {a vector or matrix (with the same dimensions as
\code{initial_state}) giving the state after the final iteration,
normalised so that the values for all stages sum to one.}
\item{\code{all_states}} {an n x m x niter matrix of the state values at
each iteration. This will be 0 for all entries after \code{iterations}.}
\item{\code{converged}} {an integer scalar or vector indicating whether
the iterations for each matrix have converged to a tolerance less than
\code{tol} (1 if so, 0 if not) before the algorithm finished.}
\item{\code{iterations}} {a scalar of the maximum number of iterations
completed before the algorithm terminated. This should match \code{niter}
if \code{converged} is \code{FALSE}.}
}
}
\description{
Calculate the intrinsic growth rate(s) and stable stage
  distribution(s) for a stage-structured dynamical system, encoded by a
  transition matrix, where: \code{state[t] = matrix \%*\% state[t-1]}.
}
\details{
\code{iterate_matrix} can either act on a single transition matrix
and initial state (if \code{matrix} is 2D and \code{initial_state} is a
column vector), or it can simultaneously act on \emph{n} different matrices
and/or \emph{n} different initial states (if \code{matrix} and
\code{initial_state} are 3D arrays). In the latter case, the first
dimension of both objects should be the batch dimension \emph{n}.

To ensure the matrix is iterated for a specific number of iterations, you
can set that number as \code{niter}, and set \code{tol} to 0 or a negative
number to ensure that the iterations are not stopped early.
}
\note{
because greta vectorises across both MCMC chains and the calculation of
greta array values, the algorithm is run until all chains (or posterior
samples), sites and stages have converged to stable growth. So a single
value of both \code{converged} and \code{iterations} is returned, and the
value of this will always have the same value in an \code{mcmc.list} object. So
inspecting the MCMC trace of these parameters will only tell you whether
the iteration converged in \emph{all} posterior samples, and the maximum
number of iterations required to do so across all these samples
